    <p>
    Matching Engines are a nice example for this library because they don't just 
    require fault tolerance they also require state management. 
    </p><p>
    For example, let's say the Primary instance assembled an OrderBook of 5 orders. 
    </p><p>
    If the Primary fails, the new leader must synchronize itself with the state 
    of the last OrderBook at the time the previous leader failed.
    </p><p>
    It is not enough to simply provide a 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_election">Leader Election</a> 
    process for detecting the failure and selecting a new leader from the Backups.
