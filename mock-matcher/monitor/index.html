<H1>HA Cluster Demo</H1>

<div>
<p>
This is a demonstration of the 
<a href="https://github.com/koverton/solace-ha-demo">solace-ha clustering library</a>
which provides stateful message-driven applications with fault
tolerance. This library handles all the state transitions from startup, to
backup, to active, etc. providing applications with a simple event-driven
interface for all important events.
</p>

<p>
To demonstrate the capabilities enabled by this library, I've created a sample 
Mock <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_matching_system">Order Matching Engine</a> 
that can be deployed in fault tolerant clusters of instances. These instances 
use this HA library to:
<ol>
<li> Signal to the instances when they are acting as Primary or Backup;
<li> Synchronize their state with the other instances at all times.
</ol>
</p>
